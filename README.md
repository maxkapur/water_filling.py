# water_filling.py

Water-filling algorithm with Microdot frontend.

## Ideas

- `/random/` route that just generates a random problem.
- Cache SVGs to disk on server.
- Index/landing page with a form to type in problem parameters.
- Switch order of heights/volumes in static URL API to match `level()` function
  signature.
